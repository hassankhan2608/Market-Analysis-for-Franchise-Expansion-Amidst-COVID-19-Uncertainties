# Market Analysis for Franchise Expansion Amidst COVID-19 Uncertainties

## Aim
The aim of this project is to guide a franchiser in strategically investing in 500 new supermarkets across six countries amid the ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties. The comprehensive analysis includes assessing the COVID-19 situation, economic trends, and consumer behavior to identify resilient and promising markets for supermarket expansion.

## Key Insights

### 1. Proportion of Vaccinated Individuals
We observed a significant increase in the proportion of vaccinated individuals across selected countries, ensuring a safer environment for retail expansion. The visualization of this proportion relative to the population provides crucial insights into the progress of vaccination campaigns.

### 2. Proportion of Confirmed Cases vs Deaths to Population Size
The analysis reveals that countries clustered close to zero on both axes experience lower confirmed cases and deaths relative to population size. This insight suggests effective pandemic management strategies in these nations, contributing to lower infection rates and fatalities.

### 3. Future Projections
Projections for daily new cases and deaths in selected countries offer valuable foresight for strategic decision-making. These visualizations aid in identifying trends and potential challenges, allowing the franchiser to proactively plan for future developments.

### 4. Narrowing Down Selection
Shortlisted to 13 countries, the selection was further refined based on economic and political outlook. Excluding Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Yemen, Nicaragua & Myanmar aimed to ensure a strategic and resilient market entry, prioritizing long-term success and stability.

## Conclusion
The project's extensive analysis provides a holistic understanding of the global market for supermarket expansion. By combining data science, market trends, and decision-making strategies, we've unveiled critical insights to shape the future of retail.

## Recommendations
1. **Strategic Entry**: Focus on the selected countries with optimal proportions of vaccinated individuals and lower confirmed cases and deaths relative to population size.
  
2. **Economic and Political Considerations**: Acknowledge the exclusion of specific countries based on economic and political outlook, aligning with the aim of long-term success and stability.
